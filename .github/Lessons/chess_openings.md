There are exceptions to some of these rules in some particular openings but normally these rules are followed. Although there is no strict border between the opening and middlegame but the connection of the rooks signifies the end of opening and arrival of middlegame. Let us now see some famous chess openings.

## **Some Standard Chess Opening**

### <u>Ruy Lopez:</u>

<br>
The Ruy Lopez is one of the major chess openings at all levels. It's also called Spanish Opening. Basically, At every level, e4 is the most common opening move in chess and black's e5 reply to it is natural as well. Nf3, Nc6 and Bb5 are the following moves which takes us to the Ruy Lopez. The idea behind this opening is easy to understand from White's perspective. White develops its pieces, fights for the center and is ready to castle in just next move whereas black still requires 3 more moves to do so. Black also has a lot of decent choices here, one of which is a6 known as Morphy Defense, named after the legendry chess player Paul Morphy. It may seem like Black is going to drop a pawn after Bxc6 as the e5 pawn was only guarded by the c6 knight but black can play dxc6 and to white's Nxe5, black can reply with Qd4 and black can't simultanously protect the knight as well as the pawn so white regains its lost pawn with a better postion. This opening is popular because of the reasons that it leads to interesting positions and opens doors for various strategical and tactical ideas.

### <u>Italian Game:</u>

<br>
Another very popular opening is to place the bisop at c4 instead of b5 after the sequence of moves e4 e5; Nf3 Nc6. Black normally plays Bc5 and this opening is known as the Italian Game. White has various options here like c6 and d6 which takes us to quiet Italian game which is popular even among strongest Grandmasters. Another option is playing b4 which takes us to the fascinating Evans Gambit. We will cover Evans Gambit in a separate section. The idea is pretty similar to Ruy Lopez: white develops its pieces quickly, fights for the center and is ready to castle on the next move. One interesting idea in white's play is to manuover the queenside night Nb1-d2 Nf1 Ng3 from where it keeps an eye on the important f5 square. After this, white castles kingside and finds itself in a absolutely fine position with good activity of all the pieces. Overall, the opening is a decent one.

### <u>Sicilian Defense:</u>

<br>
c5 is one of most popular responses of black to White's e4 which takes us to Sicilian Defense and it is at the same time one of the most strongest openings for black as well. The game generally leads to sharp positions and studying a little bit theory behind this opening before playing it will give you a huge advantage. Normally the game proceeds as Nf3 d6, d4 cxd4, Nxd4. At this point, black has a lot of choices which takes us to diffrent variations of the Sicilian defense like Najdorf variation if black plays a6 in which black's idea is to take under control the b5 square and not allow the white knight to jump to that square; Dragon variation if black plays g6 in which black's idea is to put the bisop on the long a1-h8 diagonal where it can be very useful both in the protection of the black king as well as it can also put a strong pressure along the a1-h8 diagonal; Scheveningen variation if black plays e6. Black's major ideas include counterplay on the half-open C file and white generally proceeds with the attack on the king side. White has many choices like richtor-rouser attack or english attack. All in all, Sicilian defense is a very versatile opening that creates sharp positions for nice tactical shorts.

### <u>Scandinavian Defense:</u>

<br>
Another very popular option for black is to directly counter attack in the center by playing d6 in response to white's e4. This takes us to the famous Scandinavian defense. White normally captures the d pawn and black recaptures with the queen. white attacks the queen with Nc6 and black normally has three good squares for the queen - a5, d6 and d8. The most popular choice out of these three is placing queen on a5 square. After this normal moves follow. Black normally plays c6, places the b8 knight on d7 and castles queenside. This opening gives a decent position to black and it is very popular among them who wants to reach a decent position using black inspite of knowing very little theory. 

### <u>French Defense:</u>

<br>
French defense is also a very popular opening for black with a lot of strategy and tactics. The basic idea behind this opening is the protection of the f7 pawn which is the weakest pawn as it is guarded by only the king and it is easy to attack. This vulnerability is the basic idea in King's Gambit and Fool's Mate. Black's e6 reply to e4 eliminates all the chances of attack on a2-g8 diagonal and the further next moves result in a solid position. Black's only disadvantage in this opening is the light coloured bisop which most players believe that it's good to exchange that bisop in the opening itself by playing b6 and Ba6. The position normally remains closed and it requires a good knowledge of opening theory to play this opening. This opening is not very popular among beginners because of the reason that begineers often face difficulties to play in closed positions and also if they are not able to exchange the light-squared bisop they find it difficult to make their pieces active. For this reason, you should try French defense only after knowing a decent level of theory about it.

### <u>Evan's Gambit:</u>

<br>
Evan's Gambit is a fiery gambit, which can be a terrific attacking weapon in right hands. Gambit means sacrificing some materials usually one or two pawns in order to gain a quick attack by fast developement of pieces. There are a lot of gambits like King's Gambit, Queen's Gambit, Benko Gambit and so on but Evans Gambit is by far the most popular of all the gambits. At Grandmaster level, the gambit is regarded as risky but you can definitely give it a chance below GM levels. If black makes even a very small mistake or underestimates the sacrifice, white can create a brutal attack with the help of precise moves. Evan's gambit is a variation of Italian game. The moves sequences e4 e5; Nf3 Nc6; Bc4 Bc5; b4 signifies the Evan's gambit. Black normally takes the pawn with the bisop and white plays c3 kicking the bisop. After this white places its dark-squared bisop on a3 square and then castles kingside. The two bisops put a significant pressure along the diagonals and white pieces become extremely active. All in all, white has enough compensation for the sacrificed pawn. Evan's gambit is a fun to play. 

There are a lot more standard openings but these were some important ones. It's always a good idea to have some theoretical knowledge about some standard openings.
