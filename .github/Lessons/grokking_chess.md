### Pieces in the game: 
There are 6 chess pieces namely king, queen, bishop, knight, pawn, and the castle all with their unique power.<br> <br>
**KING**: It is the most powerful piece in the game. It can move one square in any direction. If the king is captured without an escape, the game ends.<br>
**CASTLE**: It is also known as the rook. It can move any number of squares front or back.<br>
**BISHOP**: It moves diagonally on the board. It stays on the same color square throughout the game. They are a very essential piece in attacking.<br>
**QUEEN**: It is a major piece in the game and it can move in any direction, any number of squares without jumping another piece.<br>
**KNIGHT**: It looks like a horse and always moves like an L. Its movement can be thought of as a two-one or one-two approach.<br>
**PAWN**: It is the most basic and also the weakest piece in the game. Though it moves a step forward it can only capture another piece diagonally. It cannot go backward.<br>

### Castling:
* A strong player makes sure to master castling. 
* Each player is allowed to castle only once.<br>

* It helps to safeguard our king by building a wall of pawns.
* One can easily win any game of chess with the right decision of when to castle. 
* It also develops your rook, brings it to the center of the board.<br>
* There are two types:<br>

### RULES for castling:
1) One cannot castle if you have moved either of the pieces involved in castling.<br>
2) If you have moved your king, then you are not allowed to castle. <br>
3) If you have moved one of your rooks, then you cannot castle to that side.<br>
4) Another thing to remember is that you cannot castle when you are in check. On the other hand, you are allowed to castle if your rook is under attack.<br>
5) You also have to make sure that there are no pieces between the rook and the king to the side you want to castle.<br>

### Common Tactics:
**En Prise**: Look for the vulnerable pieces and also protect your pieces that are not defended.<br>
**Fool's Mate**: It is the fastest checkmate which occurs in just two moves, it capitalizes on a few key mistakes by your opponent. It can be achieved by black, on the second move with their queen.<br>
**Forks**: Generally knights are the best pieces for this because they can take out two opposing pieces in one move. <br>
**Pins**: Pin your opponent's pieces in, using your queen, rooks, and bishops. It restricts the movement of the opponent.<br>
**Skewers**: It is the opposite of a pin, a skewer is when you force a piece to move to avoid being captured, and at the same time, your rival leaves a lesser piece vulnerable to attack.<br>
**Trading**: Remember to trade your least valuable pieces.<br><br>

### Strategy tips :
1) Develop your pieces quickly, that is make sure to take more space on the board.
2) Save the queen moves, don't move them too soon. Also, avoid moving the same piece multiple times.
3) Castle early. Move the rook to the center of the board and make sure the king is safe.

## Checkmate Patterns:
Checkmate often known as a mate is a technique to capture the opponent's king such that there is no other way to escape. <br><br>

### Chess Endgame:
It is the stage of the game when only a few pieces are left on the board. <br>

The king becomes stronger in the endgame. <br>

 #### Stalemate:
It is the situation during endgame when the king cannot move though it is not under check.<br> This is because if the king moves it becomes vulnerable. <br>In this condition,the game end in a draw.

### Tips to make your endgame stronger:
* Study practical positions and opponent's moves.
* Use the “easy-to-hard” approach.
* Push passed pawns.
* Activate your king.
* Use the principle of two weaknesses.
* Track your endgame statistics.
